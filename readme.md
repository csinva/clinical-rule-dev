# Demonstrating the use of PDR/PCS in emergency medicine on the PECARN dataset.

Code for reproducing analysis evaluating the PECARN Clinical Decision rule for prediction Intra-abdominal injury requiring intervention (IAI-I).

Documentation for useful functions is [here](csinva.io/iai-clinical-decision-rule) and for notebooks is [here](https://github.com/csinva/iai-clinical-decision-rule/tree/master/notebooks).



# Reference
- IAI data is gratefully downloaded from the open-source [PECARN website](http://pecarn.org/studyDatasets/Default) (also available here in the [data](data) folder)
    - unfortunately, PSRC data is not available open-source at this time
- makes heavy use of the [imodels](https://github.com/csinva/interpretability-implementations-demos) package
