So following that incident, I actually sat down and talked with some of the staff that sat nearby that person and also with the secretary just to give her an idea and give them an idea what to do should it happen again, and who to call and how to react. So I did a little bit of community public education. But anytime I called it was it was good.

She was out a very short amount of time and then kind of came back around. I definitely called 911 for that. It didn't end up transporting to the hospital or anything like that.

The first time was because my son has a seizure disorder. I had given him my rescue medicine at home and I didn't. it was working. It was my first time doing it. By the time they got here, medicine had actually started to work. And they stuck around. They monitored him for me and it was fine. You know they did not transport him. Second time, I just wasn't sure if it was a seizure or not. Was just a little odd for how we typically present at my house, so I did call the squad. They assessed him pretty quickly, decided it would be good to transport him down to the hospital.

WashingtonDC,What are your thoughts about research trials that test medications to treat seizures?,"""I mean, I don't think there had to have been a lot of research that went into coming up with a plan, so I feel like if it is in a trial basis that the prior research has already been done to feel like it's effective and safe to run the trial for.

WashingtonDC,What are your thoughts about research trials that test medications to treat seizures?,"""On a whole, the average person doesn't know what they're being given unless it's, you know something routine for them. And I would say in emergency situation you just want the child to get better or the person to get better. Don't necessarily have to be a child. So I guess, uhm, I guess yeah. I'm sorry, threw me off guard 'cause I'm I know when they come ask me about the approach and I did the survey I remember it being dosage so I guess the whole just the experimental medication without any research behind it, I'm on the fence.""",3,Support for research trials due to personal experiences with seizures,General approval of research trials for the advancement of medicine,Uncertainty or lack of opinion about research trials,,

Like what's happening now, even though we're not talking about that. But it, it's best to find out. You know what scientists could do.

I think it would have solved part of our problem, since we had never dealt with anything like that. We were really unaware, like is this like a seizure or is this not a seizure? We were just like, you know, is this a bad dream kind of thing. Butthen once we went through that experience, we kind of knew that this is what it is. So yeah, I think it’d be great because a lot of people don’t know what’s going on and we didn’t know. We went like on the internet, and they say if it’s 15 minutes or longer, but then the doctors say no if it’s 5 minutes or longer then you should call an ambulance.

It has to be something that you can do in an emergency situation, so that part...be able to successfully do this research study makes sense.

So I think it would be, you know if somebody is like never, you know they didn't know their child was, this is the first child or the first seizure they've ever seen, or the first time they've ever seen their child having a seizure.
