### Question: Tell me a little about your experience with seizures

Responses
1. "I didn’t really have knowledge of it. I didn't know [my son] had, you know, I didn't know where the seizure was. Or if he had like a disorder. Cause I knew he had, you know, medical problems, but when I found out what he had—what he was diagnosed with. And I didn’t, so I just saw him shake. I didn't know exactly what it was, so what I did was I called 911 and, um, was like, well look, like he's shaking and his eyes go in the back of his head and he’s got foam coming out and I said yeah, and they said he’s having a seizure. And they said, “how long has he been shaking like that? At that time, it was like 8 minutes at that time. And I thought, he having a seizure? 'cause I ain't knowing really well what a seizure was. I didn't really know what it was at the time. But when I started learning how to deal with his seizures and things and get more education on it, I started getting like like better, you know, assessing it when it happens. I know what to do. And it helped me to, like, you know, be aware of what I need to do and what I don't need to do that at that time. And I know I have to like, you have to finish it 'cause you can't like, move them or turn anything so you might break one of their bones or something. So I just what I do is I just I just sit and you know, wait until he finishes. Then I give him the medication in his rectum called...I forgot how how to pronounce the word for the medication."
2. "I grew up with a mom who had [seizures], and then I also teach special ed so I've had students that had grand mal seizures and my daughter who ((either works with or has)) non-epileptic seizures."
3. "There's a time when I used to work. I actually do research as well...half of it was with the epilepsy clinic at University of Maryland Medical Center. So I was there to test people pre and post brain resection. And like to test lower language...I don't know if you know what a WADA test is, but it’s where they actually turn off, if you will, one side of the brain and then I would give a language test to make sure that that side that they're going to do the resection that the language would still be intact...Then I have a loved one who had -they had seizures, they passed away, but so yeah, I have maybe more than a lot of the average person, some understanding or some familiarity."
4. "My daughter, when my daughter start, her eyes start rolling and she's, her body was shaking, well her limbs were shaking. And she have white stuff coming from her mouth. Will foam. When she was first born, like she was a couple of weeks, that's when it first started happening."
5. "My son has [inaudible] and he's had it. He was diagnosed in 2012. He's had seizures since 2008. We ensure that he takes his medication regularly because he has drives he does have breakthrough seizures at three to five a day."
6. "I had never dealt with seizures before, even though I'm certified in first aid and CPR, but I had to know what kind of seizure [my daughter] was having and what was causing her seizures and figure out what I do moving forward."
7. "My son had his first seizure when we were up at the hospital in, oh gosh, now it's March. And that was my first time ever. Uhm, so basically the first time, so he had a couple in a row...I will admit I didn't realize it was a seizure. His brother came and was like, uhm, his brother wasn't feeling well. And I was like OK and when I came in the room he was on the ground, he wasn't shaking or anything...I thought he was asleep, but it turns out, like in hindsight, that he was unconscious...'cause I like tried to get him up and I was calling his name and he was like just discombobulated...he was just out of and I was like, oh, we're going to the hospital...they thought he was dehydrated from not eating most of the day and not feeling great so they sent him home...my husband was warming up some dinner and he heard a strange noise and he went in my son's room and he was having a full on seizure like eyes rolling back his head, uhm, shaking everything so my husband calls, called me, and then I called the ambulance and they told us what was you know what to do and then sending the paramedic and everything."
8. "I have seen it happen to people, but I haven't really experienced it. I have seen people you know try to help out when people are going through that."
9. "So, our son, 3 1/2 weeks ago...woke up crying and, totally not making like any... no words or anything...And he wasn't answering us, just kind of staring off like past us. I mean eyes wide open, not blinking or anything...He didn't answer, and then his arms pulled together and then his legs and then his whole body just started shaking, kind of like that...it lasted about 10 minutes and at the end he fell right back asleep, and we tried to wake him up, but he was just totally out so I called the pediatrician, and she lets you know like that's a seizure. Next time go to the hospital, so we tried to get in with neurology as quickly as possible and to start treatment and...he had another one where he woke up, same thing...He didn't remember most of it, despite us trying to snap him out of it, that didn't work at all. Yeah, so we took him to the ER to another hospital and they didn't do anything...Since last Friday, every night he's woken up all but one night kind of shaking one arm sometimes, sometimes both, but each time has been very brief so nothing wrong. But they said just go to the ER children's and we'll just start, just like seeing what we can do from there so here we are."
10. "Well, I treat them regularly in the emergency department I guess. Treat patients with seizure disorders, seeing them when they're actively seizing you know, obviously giving medications to stop seizures and prevent future ones. And then I think I was reached out to 'cause my one year old had a febrile seizure this month, so that I think that prompted this possible idea so personally and professionally, I guess."

### Question: Tell me about a time when you have had to call 9-1-1…?

Responses
1. "When he finishes his seizures, I give him I give him that [medicine], then I called 911. And I'll sit there and watch him. He looked like he had a fever. He's like very feverish, really hot to the touch.And I had to let him like you know, sit—no, lay there, 'cause I'm like, I'm afraid totouch him, like you know like move his arms and stuff. So I just wait a few minutes before I can like you know, uh, like assess him and stuff and see if he's alright.And then I also...after that, it all depends. I'll probably give him like maybe some some Tylenol, but I really, don't even...if I call the ambulance, I don't give him Tylenol at all. I don't give him anything. But if it's a seizure that lasts, maybe like under 5 minutes, I'll give it to him afterwards like minutes afterwards. Maybe like 30 minutes after 'cause I'll sit there and check and see if he's gonna have another one."
2. "I've had to call a couple of times for my family. My dad was a paramedic, so...I knew like how to call 911 and stay calm and not freak out and medically I tend to do pretty good when things might be scary. I can usually remain pretty calm and just handle the situation that has to be handled without freaking out about it."
3. "I've had to call for myself. I've had to call for family. Still a little bit, not frequently, but it's happened maybe two or three times that I can recall. For other people, well, actually all the the experiences that I've had, I was able to make sound decisions. Even for me, even though I was a little bit quite stressed -in distress, but I still was able to make -fortunate enough to make a sound reasonable decision and do what they asked me to do."
4. "When she first had a seizure, my mother was called. She told me, 'cause I ain't know like, 'cause my kids' father had it before, but like...when she was on, when I had on my arm sitting on the couch, she was still asleep like she was lying down asleep. She just thought she wake up crying. She was like her eyes was rolling. She had white stuff coming out her mouth. My mother said “that's a seizure”, called her an ambulance and my mother had called me...So yeah, that's how I know what seizures is, but [my mom] had called the paramedic, the paramedic said it theyself when my daughter was having seizures. Put her on the floor, laid on her back."
5. "Specifically for my son we called an ambulance, probably once every month for the first four years of life. And then there was a stint in 2012 to 2014 where we called one properly every week."
6. "At the her first ambulance were, as far as the seizure was coming from school and for one after though they took too long to get her to get to the school to get to the hospital. And she was still having a seizure on her way to the hospital, and it ended up lasting over an hour."
7. "That was the first time…What was tiring and it was scary 'cause we didn't know what was going on."
8. Never had to call
9. "So they told us to call an ambulance, but the problem was, the ambulance would take us back to the hospital that we went to which sent us home. [Neurologist] said: “if it's one of those really long 10-minute type things where he's throwing up or that kind of thing, then no matter what to do that –and we would get transferred to children’s. If it something that’s not as badthen just go straight to children’s.” So that's kind of what we did."
10. "Well, we...tried to call 911 when my son had a seizure and uhm, they didn't pick up and by the time they called back the seizure was slowing down so I never actually spoke to them."

### Question: What are your thoughts about research trials that test medications to treat seizures?  

Responses
1. "I mean, I don't think there had to have been a lot of research that went into coming up with a plan, so I feel like if it is in a trial basis that the prior research has already been done to feel like it's effective and safe to run the trial for. So I feel like they can be beneficial and help in the long run."
2. "I think any research that's done to help people with you know, decreased seizures. I think. I think it's great. I think it's important. It's necessary because there's a lot of damage that can occur for some people who have repeated seizures. So I think it's good, useful."
3. "I don’t have an answer for that."
4. "I think it's important [because] I have a family member who suffers from a severe form of epilepsy and so we have a lot of seizure activity at two, I think because he has drive as we have experienced a lot of medication failures that are not able to stop or prevent him from having seizures. I think it's important for the advancement of medicine so that one day we can get to a place where he doesn't have to have seizures."
5. "I'm not against it, I believe that it's part, it's probably a good idea because I'd rather a research study to find out more about it and secure my daughter so she won't have seizures than to be put through that every time when she has a seizure."
6. "On a whole, the average person doesn't know what they're being given unless it's, you know something routine for them. And I would say in emergency situation you just want the child to get better or the person to get better. Don't necessarily have to be a child. So I guess, uhm, I guess yeah. I'm sorry, threw me off guard 'cause I'm I know when they come ask me about the approach and I did the survey I remember it being dosage so I guess the whole just the experimental medication without any research behind it, I'm on the fence."
7. "I think it's OK to do a research on a lot of you know people to find out what's going on 'cause all of our bodies are different so things happen, you know, so it's good to find out what's going on. Like what's happening now, even though we're not talking about that. But it, it's best to find out. You know what scientists could do. For all of us out here to help everybody."
8. "It's fantastic. I think it would have solved part of our problem, since we had never dealt with anything like that. We were really unaware, like is this like a seizure or is this not a seizure? We were just like, you know, is this a bad dream kind of thing. Butthen once we went through that experience, we kind of knew that this is what it is. So yeah, I think it’d be great because a lot of people don’t know what’s going on and we didn’t know. We went like on the internet, and they say if it’s 15 minutes or longer, but then the doctors say no if it’s 5 minutes or longer then you should call an ambulance. So I think that [information] would have been helpful."
9. "Well, I think it makes sense that they're not able to sign informed consent due to the emergency of the study, and it has to be something that is already, you know we're not able to get on the time to sign and agree to the study. It has to be something that you can do in an emergency situation, so that part...be able to successfully do this research study makes sense. I think it's important that we have studies like this, otherwise we'll never be able to advance the field of how to treat an emergency, how to treat patients in an emergency situation."

### Question: In that moment, when a paramedic is getting ready to treat your child who is having a seizure, would you have been able to make an informed decision about whether or not to participate in a research study? 

Responses
1. Yes
2. "I don't want to make that decision in the moment, I would want to know more about it."
3. "For me, I think because I have some experience, I would say yes because I feel like I understand what that entails. But then again, you know it's an emergency situation and I don't know if you know how you're going to act or what you're going to really think and do in any situation, but I'd like to think that if I understood, like if I'm explained, the, you know what the research is or the experimental component is that I would be able to still make a decision that that would be right or that I feel would be right for my child in that moment."
4. Yes
5. "I think generally speaking, most parents are not probably in the best position to make that kind of decision. I think they're more they want to spend more of their brain power focused on the child and making sure the child is getting what the child needs."
6. "During the seizure, no, 'cause like that's not where my focus is…'cause it's not a normal situation, so not knowing what is going on with that child with it, that's just stressful for anything and you just wishing and hoping that they're better, especially when it's your first time and you don't know what's causing it."
7. "No, I wouldn't be able to know if I was in that predicament. I don't think I would."
8. Yes
9. "I wouldn't want any further delay of giving the medication, so I don't think it's reasonable to talk to a parent if they want to participate in the risk benefit. I mean, I probably could have made that decision being I've been involved in research and medical professional, but I don't think it's fair to ask a typical parent to do that?"

### Question: Would you want somebody else to decide if your child could be a research subject?  If so, who?

Responses
1. No
2. "I feel like the paramedics would have the best intentions for my child. I would have to trust their medical background in their knowledge."
3. No
4. Yes
5. "I don't think so. I think that's a personal decision that should be made by the parent."
6. Yes, "like a family member or close friend."
7. "Oh yeah, of course of course, 'cause I look at it as my life. Hopefully that they would do the right choice."
8. Yes, "I think I would hope that they would have called 911 and the paramedics. I would trust them to do that"
9. "I guess I'm saying I don't think it's saying they're asked. I think there should be a waiver of informed consent so that's kind of what I'm getting at that. It's not really fair to ask anyone in that emergent situation to make that decision."

### Question: Who would you want to make that decision, if you were unable and a family member or close friend (or other proxy mentioned) were not available in time? 

Responses
1. "I really don't know the answer to that one."
2. "Then I would not want them to be given an experimental anything."
3. "Then there's a lost opportunity to gain valuable information that could potentially help the research team."
4. "If it's gonna help my daughter, I'm OK with someone else making that decision."
5. "If they see that that I'm helpless. If you know like I said, if you come close enough to mouse and almost look like the swallowing gear, you should be able to make that choice."

### Question: What do you think could be some of the challenges when doing research on emergency, time-sensitive conditions?

Responses
1. "I don't know how to answer that, I'm being honest."
2. "I stay pretty calm in those situations. But I think if they were like we're going to give her, you know a, you know we're testing treatment for seizures and children and we want to give her this experimental dose to help stop her seizures. I think it would depend on how it was presented. So I think it would be, you know if somebody is like never, you know they didn't know their child was, this is the first child or the first seizure they've ever seen, or the first time they've ever seen their child having a seizure. That could be way different situation than mine where I can look and go 'oh yeah, she's having a seizure, yeah? Go ahead and give it, you know that's fine.'...I think it depends on your situation."
3. "Time lost. Just that. Time lost that could potentially be life saving or decrease damage to the brain. Death. So time really, it could save a lot of precious time."
4. "I don’t know how to answer that question."
5. "Probably the biggest challenge is making sure that the paramedic team can multitask. The nurse, something that they have to do or capture information or data that they have to document. In that process, you know just making sure that they don't lose focus on on the main thing and the main thing is keeping a child you know, alive and doing well as well as can be, you know, under the circumstances."
6. "What might come up is people who people not participate in time, money."
7. "Just a time like you don't have it, so it's like you're making an immediate decision without, you know, and it's time sensitive like you don't have time to research and weigh the options."
8. "Trying to try to stay calm number one and try to think hard of what I should do. You know the you know 'cause you can freak out real quick when you see somebody doing that. You know if your mind you know something you your mind is like a challenge. You know when people going through that, so it's like a it's a shock and a challenge."
9. "Getting it out to parents I think is a big challenge. Just because you know they tell you in the doctor's office like they could have a fever and get a seizure that way, butthey don't tell you about all the other kinds of seizures that there are and what to look for. I think just making it available, you know, at like the pediatricians. Not that every parent is going to sit there and read all this stuff. But gosh if I had known a non-febrile type seizure I'd certainly been like --hey that's a seizure, not a bad nightmare."
10. "The only way to do these studies successfully and to get the numbers in enrollment, we have a waiver of informed consent. And I suspect...more and more complicated process to get a waiver because you need to have make sure it's gone through the right protections to protect the general public. If there's a waiver of informed consent and there should be more steps to it, it should be more complicated, but it's necessary."

### Question: What do you think are the benefits of doing research in emergency situations without a patient’s informed consent?

Responses
1. "This is a difficult one because, yeah, if it's going to be life saving, sure, but I guess we don't know that and so, because it's research, there's so much that's not known right? That's why we're doing research about the drug. I would hate for like even one complication to happen or one death or one thing, even just one, as a result potentially. And if a family didn't know that's the care that they were getting. I don't know. That's a very difficult question for me to answer."
2. Nothing
3. "I think the potential benefit is to be able to capture and document, you know, good information that could help make advancements to medicine."
4. "I would say the benefits is someone who's taking the time out to figure out how to do emergency and emergency situations to help out."
5. "I feel like in most life threatening situations, you just want the person to come out of it ahead. So in in the emergency situation, you don't particularly care or know what is being given to you, you just hope it works. So I would imagine that would be it for everybody."
6. "Nothing that comes to mind right away."
7. "We don't have time to properly get consent or we won't be able to administer the treatment. So the only way to do this research, which can really benefit patients these situations, is to do it with a waiver of consent...and ultimately, you know, we feel the benefits that the patients in the study way outweigh the risks in the study then also in the general population."

### Question: A minor CHILD/family member is having a seizure when the paramedics arrived to your home. He/she meets the qualifications to participate in the pedidose study. Would you agree to have him or her being included in the research study without your permission or your family's permission ahead of time?

Responses
1. No, disagree
2. Yes, agree
3. "No, not if I didn't know anything about it."
4. Yes, agree "They helped my before-Before, they helped my child out."
5. Yes, agree "If I'm giving permission ahead of time in the event that it occurs, I think I would have had ample opportunity to to make a decision on whether or not I think it's appropriate to participate in the study."
6. Yes, agree
7. Yes, participate
8. Yes, participate
9. Yes, participate
10. Yes, participate. "Ultimately, what's going to treat the seizure?...If they are a little bit too sedated and then the other risk is that the medicine is not enough because they're at the you know there is an age range and they're a bigger kid, but then they'd have to give multiple doses. Uhm, so I think either way you're getting the medicine in faster."

### Question: If this study did not involve an emergency, and we had time to consent you before treatment, what would be your decision to have your child participate?

Responses
1. Yes, participate
2. Yes, participate
3. "I mean, I would have questions, like a bunch of questions so, I would probably ask those. And then if, depending on how satisfied I was and or understood-to really clarify my understanding, that's how I would make my decision. I'd want to know how much-how much more effective or how, you know what is the percentage of, you know kids who you know are not surviving, or who are having significant damage because they're still seizing. What is that, you know, I kind of would want to understand a little bit more about why the need, for this age, type of dose. Like what are the statistics, just to understand like wow, it must be really significant, like a lot of kids are either dying or really becoming impaired because they weren't able to stop before they got to the emergency room. So just whatever I understood, that's what would determine whether or not I would be OK and what's the risks."
4. Yes, participate "It's helping me. It's helping me and my child out."
5. "Yeah, I think I mean, I think it's always good to obtain someone consent so they can participate in this study. Obviously there are, you know, great benefits by having the Community participate in this study so that you could make advancements in science and medicine."
6. "I would want them to"
7. Yes, participate. "I would still want you know the best decision you know and still a time sensitive, I mean, even though it's not an emergency, you still want the care."
8. Well, if I didn't have emergency, well, like I say, it still will be wishy washy 'cause I still think it if it doesn't really involved in this kind of situation, you know. It's pretty, you know, it's sort of pretty hard in both sides, but if you do, you know, yeah, but if you don't, you know there's no need to. And my decision on it, I wouldn't be looking for no kind of treatment 'cause why would you try to treat somebody that don't have that kind of problem?
9. Yes, participate
10. "Well, if you not an emergency then you should be able to get the most accurate weight, so that really doesn't...You know, if it's not an emergency, then you would argue then you should have a weight based dosing."

### Question: How important do you think it is to do this study in your community?

Responses
1. "I think it would be [important]. Uh, I did great help you know to get some more out more ideas out there. So something they can like really, you know focus on work on and see how it works and so it would be good to have to have something like this."
2. "I mean it's it's another tool for paramedics in the the immediate care prior to getting to the emergency department."
3. "Very, I think, any, particularly because it's-obviously we've identified the need, so I think that it should be conducted, I think. Actually, I think more research should be conducted about lots of things, but I don't think that it should be done without an attempt to notify the community that you're talking about."
4. "I think I mean I think it's important to find ways to treat seizures and and reduce any damage that can happen from a child having a seizure. So if by collecting this additionaldata helps do that I think that's important amazing."
5. "Really important"
6. "I mean I think people need to be aware, so I think it's important. At least if you know about ahead of time and they ask, then it's not as stressful 'cause at least is not your first time and maybe you've thought about and done your research."
7. "Studying the community would be good because we didn't like I say we don't know how many people out here they said in community is going through their situation. None of us enough never know."
8. "Very important"

1. "To find a quickest, faster way to treat the child before they come. I mean before they arrive to the hospital so they get treated by the doctors. And things like to stabilize them so they can, you know, be relaxed and you know."
2. "It's taking out the measuring of the [medication] and getting medication administered more quickly."
3. "To prevent kids having a seizure all the way to the hospital to stop him before go too long."
4. "To stop it, a child or having the paramedics with the right medication to not have a child having a full blown seizure by the time they get to the emergency room."
5. "My understanding is the purpose is is getting to learn each human being out here and more like to find out about a person having a seizure, you know or not 'cause it might help the situation as a little as they grow as if it might stop it."
6. "So we are trying to get more timely administration of anti epileptics, interactive seizing patients, uhm, with using more general age based dosing versus weight based calculations."

Themes
- Theme 1: Quick administration of medication [2, 6]
- Theme 2: Prevention of seizures before reaching the hospital [1, 3, 4]
- Theme 3: Understanding and learning about seizures [5]

### Question: What is your understanding about why the ambulance agencies will be randomly assigned to when they will switch methods of dose determination?

Responses
1. "I don't know how to answer that question."
2. "It just varies on who's giving what at what time during the study."
3. "You need to because it should be random. I mean randomized controlled studies are, I mean, I guess like gold standard and so that no, so that no one area or no one section of the community is getting... so it’s blind, I don't know."
4. "I think it's so that you can't capture enough data randomly so that this study is has enough information to to make conclusions."
5. "I don't have no opinion on it…That is going to eventually switch over, just take some time."
6. "I just think just so is my bias. And so, like, would one ambulance be biased towards...Well, you don't want it to be in just a certain area, like if it's randomly assigned then you could say it was random."
7. "I don't well my understanding would be good for them to you know 'cause ambulances out here to help you out here to help you?"
8. "I don't have too much understanding of that. I don't know if it's just like a placebo effect to see you know does this work or this didn’t type thing?"
9. "We don't want to have everyone do it at once. You want to be able to compare to people who are using the current method to. Then you know at the same time point versus everyone changing now. Then, there could be something else going on at the same time, that is why you see an effect or not in effect. So by randomly assigning them over time, it helps minimize the biases of everyone changing at the same time."

### Question: What concerns, if any, do you have about the random assignment of the ambulance agencies regarding when they switch to the new method of dosing?

Responses
1. "I'm kind of wary because some kids might have like nerds reactions to certain things. And then some. Sometimes you know permits don't know what that is, so that's I guess that's why they asked. The parents, what kind of allergies they have? Even though the parent would know what allergies that that child has, sometimes they can take a pill, or, like you know, like a like a like an injection or something. It might get a relation action to it, 'cause it might be something in it. To like break them out so now they'll be, you know. Be out out in hives and they gotta now they gotta put steroids in the child."
2. "I can't think of a reason why it would matter."
3. "New dosing, because, like, OK, so the medicine already making-like it's already making her like drowsy and stuff. Just [muffled] looking into space and stuff. And so, I got a worry about her like-I got a worry about it like. 'cause you know that dose was-it's higher than the dose that she had. I got a worry about like her being off a little bit

### Question: What are your fears or worries, if any, regarding the study? 

Responses
1. "Concerned about what's gonna happen after you know after? After they give that that dose."
2. "Just people being quick to sue, because like consent wasn't given and why would you do that to my baby type stuff like. I mean we're not that way, but there are people that look for any excuse you know excuse and you know, even if it wasn't you know, even if something happened tothe child and it wasn't the result of the pedidose, like would they try to turn that?"
3. "I think it would be like a worst case scenario, happening, right, like where the medication, even though it's the gold standard, because like I said, my thought is just kids of the same age are wildly different weights and if too much that's administered could impair breathing, and you're doing this based on a 10 year old who's very small or who's very big, whatever, and they get more than they should. Right?"
4. No
5. "I think my only concern would be for children who already have been diagnosed with epilepsy and participating in the study. I don't know if it's true across the board, but I know that my you know, my child specifically is significantly underweight. He is in high school and if you looked at his dose, he's the equivalent of like size-wise of like an 8 year old...I think the problem you will have is for children who already are diagnosed with epilepsy. They generally are smaller in size due to medications and because medications slow development and a lot of their children have severe epilepsy...may have other complex issues occurring such as you know issues with eating or feeding, and so...I think my my concern would be...while you guys are looking into this, trying to determine which study is best...you're trying to come up with a better plan to provide faster services to people, but generally speaking you know when a child has a tonic clonic seizure that is long lasting, lasting, more than 20 minutes, so likelihood that you're going to be able to...stop that seizure with any medication that's on an ambulance is probably unlikely. And I say that just based on experience I you know I have a child that's had three and four hour long seizures, and there's no amount of medication in a hospital or even in ER, that can often stop it on its own."
6. "I don't have any"
7. No
8. No
9. "Just that, like I said, there are some kids who are really small for their age, but other kids were really big for their age. So just that you know it might not be as effective or too effective."

### Question: How do you feel about not having a choice about participation in the study?

Responses
1. "I would feel like upset about it, especially if I'm not aware of it. And what's going on? I would be like very upset about it if I didn't know anything about it."
2. "You have called the EMS for an emergency. They're there to do their job, and in that moment they're making that decision. What's best for your child?...I think it's trusting in the paramedics in your community, really."
3. "It's less about not having choice, because I understand that sometimes things need to be done or administered to save a life and they could be unconventional, sure, but this is a study like that's being planned, so there's also time to plan and figure out. Just like you sort of are with the survey, but because like you said everyone who goes into the ER is not necessarily going to be the same people who end up in the ER because like-what I'm saying is, you found me in the ER and so, I happen to be there. But if I had not been there that day, there should still be a way that I understand that it's possible if my child for some reason were to go to Children’s because of a seizure, they could be in this study and sort of just explain that at the very least, that's due diligence...There's a reason why we have informed consent, so as much as is humanly possible and reasonable to get the message out that this is going on in your community and this could be the case. I don't know whether there's an opt in or opt out. I guess not. I don't think that that's as important as just informing the people."
4. "I think most people want to help. So while you may not have a choice in participating at the time, I think a lot of people would be encouraged to know that...what they're pursuing and you know, may help advance medicine or save another person's life."
5. "If I choose not to, I shouldn't be putting it if I didn't agree to it."
6. "I don't care"
7. "I feel this is pretty good of learning"
8. "It doesn't bother me."

### Question: Why do you feel that way, and are those reasons related to prior experiences you or others have had?

Responses
1. "Depends on the parents. And how you know you know how that child responds to the, to the, to the medication? Or the you know the injections that's given doses injection is given 'cause sometimes parents don't know how much they children weigh."
2. "I trust the paramedics in my community because I think people that are paramedics do it for the the further right intentions, and they're not going to make decisions to harm anybody. You know they chose that job for a reason. I'm going to trust them to do their job. I'm not asking them to come in and teach my high school class, I'm asking them to do their job. So I mean it's trusting in the job that they know how to do."
3. "You're not doing nothing but trying to help me out."
4. "No, I just feel as though I'm an adult and if I if I didn't give you if I don't give you permission then I don't feel as though that you should do something without my consent. [regarding interviewee's child:] If I give you consent to help her, or if she needs help, then I have no problem."
5. "You know, I think just life like it's hard to say that you're gonna have 100% of anything like something that's even a majority like you still have those few that feel different and they have their reasons why they do. Whether it just be personal experience, how they grew up like you'll never get 100% or anything. So I feel like, you know, like just my son having a seizure if they gave him medication and the ambulance, what it was, I couldn't tell you. You know, after the fact you'll be like, oh, they gave him this and you'll do your research, but in that moment, and I think unless you have a medical background, then you probably wouldn't care."
6. No prior experiences
7. "Just because I think it's kind of important, it's important to help out, you know, figure out the best method to treat people with these seizures or anything."
8. "Well, my experience as a I mean I'm in pediatric medicine to do research, so obviously that...I have a better understanding of research and emergency medicine, so I think that's going to make me feel more comfortable doing it, I would say."

### Question: What, if anything, is there that could change regarding the details of this study to make you feel comfortable with being enrolled without your permission?

Responses
1. "As long as it's it's a person know ahead of time 'cause I know that you know, like the ambulance, they have like a tablet. You know they have a tablet that they work with and they ask, you know your information. They know child name and all the information and stuff. And they can act on that...Is there interest in that seizure study after they get the child information? So that would be better and then they also would get you after that if they if the parent, parent parents or parent agree. Then they can sign it."
2. "If there's ways that you can change it to make people feel more comfortable because it is a in the moment decision that has to be made. And it's a decision whether it'd going to help your child or not, and I think most parents would be like 'oh hey, you could do it."
3. "Some effort and more than just giving, you know, a survey to the small number of people who come in to the ED compared to, probably how many people potentially will be in the study and who it could affect. But there should be every reasonable attempt made to let the community know that this is happening in their community. Maybe, uh, commercials-Children's has commercials on TV, they send flyers out for all kinds of things. Like there's the ability –there's e-mail –there's the ability to do as much as possible to have, uh, to have let the community know that this is happening. Everyone’s not going to read it, but at least that will have been done."
4. "I think probably what would be helpful is if you had a way to communicate to the parent after the fact that kind of gave them an overview of what the study was and what information was collected and and how their participation in the in the program you know will you know help make advancements in science and and I think that could probably be best. I think that that could be through a text message after after their child is admitted to the hospital."
5. Nothing
6. Nothing
7. Nothing; "I guess if they were limiting it to even more, even fewer people, you know, not studying a big enough group—I think that that would be problematic."

### Question: How do you think this study might improve medical care for children with seizures?

Responses
1. "Make the guess…planning better"
2. "Improve mental health care for children with seizures. I mean if they can stop them from seizing in if they're having an epileptic seizure and there is, you know, brain damage occurring just on the the sheer nature of what seizure you know happens with seizures. It can stop,you know, potential brain damage in children."
3. "How it would improve care is that children are getting immediate relief or care from something that has the potential to do a lot of damage or can be life-threatening, that there's those precious minutes could be saved. So I mean, I think there's-it sounds very important."
4. "Helping out more"
5. "I think it probably will have the best benefit for children who are not normally who have not been diagnosed with epilepsy of some sort. Those parents are probably the ones that are more scared as they proceed through like that type of issue and so I think it it probably will help improve their medical care. But for children which you know with epilepsy, I mean, I think we're all pretty well informed and we know what medications and we almost all carry emergency meds on us so I don't know if there's really any...I can't tell you very many EMTs that have come up to me that I've known more about epilepsy even than I have, so I'm here."
6. "I think it would be great because if it cuts down on the time that they're having a seizure, you know, the less time they're having it, the better it is, the better the outcome. So I I can't see nothing wrong with it."
7. "It will help a lot. It will help the parents to learn and understand it."
8. "I think it could greatly improve this because it would potentially be more beneficial to kids having a seizure if they're given medicine that would help right?--That’s a much easier way to deal with administering that medication."
9. "Faster and the epileptic dose to prevent morbidity from long seizures"

3. "Other research hospitals. Sometimes when I've gone to the doctor's office, and they're not even affiliated with Children’s, you'll see studies. “NIH is doing a study for blahblahblah.” Like they have that in the you know, in the pediatricians' office so, collaborating with medical other hospitals or just to get the message out that Children’s is. I don't know if that's done, but like maybe coordinating with other similar, you know, health care providers...So just collaborating beyond maybe Children’s. And I don't know whether or not this-'cause you said the ED, so that sounds like you said that primarily, right now, the survey is being conducted with people in the ED? So, the ED just happened to be this time, the Child and Adolescent primary care clinics. Well there, they could have people there during the day, not just in the emergency room but with parents who were coming just for primary care. Because there are studies being done just like that, yeah. So, not just relying on ‘all these families are coming into the ED, let's give them a survey.’ As much as possible while people are seeing providers for other appointments also giving them an opportunity."

2. "So just reaching those people you know in that in that moment you know after things have settled down and you're talking with parents, you know we are doing a study. Would this be something you would be interested in and that's a way to reach people that are dealing with the situation. And you're going to get different people just based on because seizures don't discriminate."
