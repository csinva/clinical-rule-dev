### Question: Tell me a little about your experience with seizures

Responses
1. I've seen various types. A stereotypical full body. I think they call them tonic clinic's. Where someone will just stare off and not do anything for a while. I know you with Pediatrics. The biggest thing I've seen with kids is febrile. I worked with [a guy with a seizure disorder] when I was in high school.  I worked at the McDonald's and he worked in the grill with me and he told. Me up front then. He said if I start to stare off, he said grab me by the arms and Get Me Out of here so I don't get hurt
2. All of my experience has been on, whether it be pediatric or  adult seizures, I don't have any personal family with seizures. Generally, by the time. EMS arrives, the seizure has ended, but we've had, people start to seize and convulse while in our care
3. My son has had seizures since 2016. He was four in his first one and it took us to the ER and then got him life lifted to the local hospital and then we followed up with neurology and he's had a couple more seizures where we've been taken to the emergency room. We've been life flighted. I think twice for his seizures to a hospital cause he's in status and  then we've taken him the local hospital and he's gotten out of the seizure a couple of times just by what they've done.  We did take an ambulance ride down to nationwide from our local hospital and got an overnight stay because of the seizures  We recently actually had a surgery through nationwide children for his epilepsy to try to hit the focus of where it's coming from. So that's our experience
4. I've not personally experienced a seizure, nor have my children, but I used to work in the Emergency Medicine Research Department and we participated in studies that involved seizures, and that's my experience with them
5. Yes, I have twice been to the emergency room for both my kids having a febrile seizure. When my daughter was two, she had one right on Christmas Day. It was it was very scary. And then my son had one, a few weeks before his second birthday. He was just about to turn two. And then he had a febrile seizure
6. My son has what is called Gervais syndrome.  There's three different types of seizures I can't think of all of them off the top of my head. The worst one would be grandmal seizures.  We've had to call EMS multiple times for him being unresponsive, he twitches on the floor.  We have to put him on his side, we have a rescue medication called Nazalam.  That's if a seizure lasts more than five minutes, we have to give him through his nostril. He hasn't had one in a while. But he's had multiple ones throughout the years
7. My experience with seizures has all been related to other people. Neither I nor any of my children currently have seizures, either seizure disorder and no febrile seizures during their their life, or child in college. I'm a 25 year paramedic for the City of Columbus so I've had a lot of run responses on people with seizures, and I've had some interaction with people, either public gatherings or at my job on the side. And in that office, for a period of time, we had a gentleman who had a seizures that was traced to a brain tumor. So I did some initial first responder care for him a number of times when he seized, that's my experience
8. OK so am I speaking as a parent, I don't know If I've ever had any of my kids have a seizure, but I have seen as a medic.  As paramedic, I do go on them occasionally and I haves seen how parents act and react and how family members act as well
9. My middle son has had seizures and difficulty breathing
10. Yes, my son does have seizures, has had them since he was six months so I initially did not know what it was. It was not what I would not have recognized as a seizure. So we called the pediatrician, sent a video and ended up driving two children. Initially, I think I've had one other instance where I did call the squad for a seizure

### Question: Tell me about a time when you have had to call 9-1-1…?

Responses
1. A family member, difficulty breathing. Older lady, didn't want me to call 911.    Called the local squad came in.I did initial assessment or summary. I think it's muscle memory. I turned into paramedic, did the initial assessment on, and when the family or when the squad showed up. One of the members knew me, so they asked me what was going on
2. My grandma she had sudden onset atrial fibrillation. It was undiagnosed at that time, so she said, you know she's feeling. Dizzy and I took her pulse, noticed A-fib so we got an ambulance for at that time
3. I've called the ambulance for my son for the seizures.  We only actually called them once and the other times we just took him right to the hospital cause we live close to the hospital. I've also called 911 for strangers. I work in healthcare, so I've called 911 before for other people.  I've had seizure situations and I called 911 for somebody I was working with
4. The only we've had to call any ambulances for our kids or for my husband and I have vasovagal syncope and will pass out on occasion, so I've had ambulances called for me. Sometimes I take them, sometimes I don't
5. Wow, I've had to call them on my kids, my mom, and my grandfather, more for my grandma and my mom and my grandpa, they're having health issues.  For my kids, it seemed like they took forever. It really did. It seemed like it took them a lot longer to get here then expected we have a firehouse, literally right down the street from where we live. And it took them, I want to say eight to 10 minutes just to get to our house. And it seems like that especially when my kids were in that seizure just seemed like it was very long.  So it's frantic, like it's not calming?
6. The first time we ever had to call 911. He was having a grand Mal seizure. He turned black and blue and was unresponsive for more than 10 minutes and we had to call EMS out to revive him.  We don’t call unless they last more than 6 minutes after the emergency med has been introduced. If it lasts that extra minute, then we have to call EMS
7. Yes, first time it occurred, I was not the person that made the phone call, I instructed someone else to make the phone call. And it was a little bit chaotic. So following that incident, I actually sat down and talked with some of the staff that sat nearby that person and also with the secretary just to give her an idea and give them an idea what to do should it happen again, and who to call and how to react.  So I did a little bit of community public education. But anytime I called it was it was good. And actually each time I had medics arrive here that were medics I had mentored in their process becoming medics, so that that was different. Great, it relaxes the whole situation for everybody
8. Yeah, so the most recent one was my wife basically, I think her blood pressure dropped really low. I kind of knew it was coming on or felt like it was coming on and gave me a heads up. I didn't get in there in time and she hit her head on the way down on the toilet and had what I think was a very short seizure.  She was out a very short amount of time and then kind of came back around. I definitely called 911 for that. It didn't end up transporting to the hospital or anything like that. It was more of hey, let's check her vital signs and all that kind of jazz. I was comfortable with her not going to the hospital not being seen
9. When my son a stopped breathing during a seizure.  Actually I was driving so I had to take him to the emergency room, urgent care was our closest place in which called an ambulance to take him to the emergency sleep room
10. It was positive. I've called the squad twice. Both were positive interactions. I felt like they were very professional, very calm. The first time was because my son has a seizure disorder. I had given him my rescue medicine at home and I didn't. it was working. It was my first time doing it. By the time they got here, medicine had actually started to work. And they stuck around. They monitored him for me and it was fine. You know they did not transport him. Second time, I just wasn't sure if it was a seizure or not. Was just a little odd for how we typically present at my house, so I did call the squad. They assessed him pretty quickly, decided it would be good to transport him down to the hospital. I don't remember if they gave him any medicine on the way or if they felt like it was an active seizure at the time. I just don't recall, but felt very confident that they had it under control

### Question: What are your thoughts about research trials that test medications to treat seizures? 

Responses
1. As long as it's safe for the patient and it's gonna come out and it's in the end. Come out with better ways to treat and help people. I'm all for trial for research and trials. My thoughts are when treating patients when doing anything. I'd like to do the best I can to help the person help the community, so if there's a research trial or something that'll make it easier and better for me and my peers to do that. Help the people. I'm all for it
2. I'm all in favor of something that's going to benefit a large population that we serve. So with Pediatrics and their short medical history if you will come when a seizure happens. We don't always have a lot of ground that we can cover medically with them. So the trials to test the medications. I'm all in favor of
3. Very needed, I think it's needed.  Because one of my experiences with my son is that we made it to the hospital and they used the tape to figure out what to do, some math and it took forever to get him out of one of the seizures and it was pretty frightening.  So if we can find a better, faster way to get the kids out of their seizures. I'm happy to do it and obviously in safe measures cause I don't want them to overdose somebody
4. I understand why you would want to do something like that, because the goal is to move as quickly as possible, right?  So I understand why you would do that, and I think you're basing it on age which is probably based on weight percentile.  Is that sort of how they're discovering putting people into age buckets?  Are they using like a weight percentile because in pediatrics you use weight based dosing, right?
5. I think it's good to find other ways to treat seizures without having to know like the child's weight, because it is hard to figure out the weight of a child. You know, especially with the frantic parents seeing their child seizing, like their minds are on their child wanting to make sure that they're okay. I know personally, I couldn't answer the weight, or anything.  When they asked me if I could give them my child's birthday and name.  You know, so I think the research where it goes by like the age of a child is actually really good. And I think that if a child or anybody's having a seizure, I think the medicine should just be given to them automatically without consent, I think so, it's gonna save their lives, I do
6. I think research would be great to learn more about it
7. My first thought, I'm fairly pro research. So I would be looking for what is best for my child. So I would be less fearful of research. As long as it is a treatment involved and the  goal is better care
8. For paramedics I'm OK with it. I think it's a great. In my opinion, you're going to make it simpler for paramedics to act quicker and not hesitate. Making it so either having to do less calculations in their head or pulling out a calculator to calculate an accurate dose. Anything that's going to make it simpler, ultimately, for the paramedic to me is going to give better results for the kid.  And secondly, I think for the medications that I've experienced giving a child, you can still manage their airway. You can still handle getting them to the hospital. I'm OK with it. I think it's a great idea and the risks to me for the things I've seen, the medications I've used, can still be managed, so I'm definitely for something to help medics act quicker and more responsively
9. I think it's great
10. I would want to weigh the benefits. Obviously you're going to weigh the benefits versus the risk. I want that seizure to stop as quickly as possible, so I personally would say yes every single time, right? I don't want to waste a lot of time making sure that it's the right medicine. Just give them something to stop

### Question: In that moment, when a paramedic is getting ready to treat your child who is having a seizure, would you have been able to make an informed decision about whether or not to participate in a research study? 

Responses
1. Probably not, being a worked up parent. I just recently took my son to the hospital last year when he broke his leg and I had to think for a bit before I would be there when they would give us the treatment decisions. So as a parent, pretty much my ability to make informed decisions starts I start. I feel like I start losing it, and I've seen other parents with the same, just do what's best for my child
2. The answer would be yes, I'm pretty sure
3. I think that'll be challenging because even though I work in health care as a nurse, when I'm taking care of my own patients, the level of clear headedness that I have is different than when something is going on with my own kid. Like when it's your own child, you're more emotionally charged.  I think it's more challenging in the moment.  To weigh a ton of options like if you don't have something sort of planned out like OK, I know in this situation I do X. You know, if it's something completely unexpected and you don't really know, I think it can be more challenging
4. Yes, I would give my consent for that if they have asked me and if they told me that there's this new research going on. Yeah, I would be up for it
5. Yes
6. As a parent, I would be looking to get treatment now. Worry about paperwork later.  I would hope so. I know, based on my experience on the street, it's not always the case.  Sometimes it's especially as the new medic I felt that fell on the senior medics. Now as a senior medic, you know, we do a lot to pull the family member aside and get them into a calmer, more manageable state. So by that I mean, I would want people to make that decision.  And I would have no problem with participating as part of I'm adding
7. Me personally, I think so, but I'd be annoyed. Why are you asking me about this, obviously knowing about it and having the history I do, I'd be fine with it, but I think a lot of parents would probably be, just just fix my kid. I guess since we know about it, I'd be OK with it because the paramedics would already know and understand what they're doing. Really, the only delay in treatment is having to ask
8. Yes
9. No, I wouldn't

### Question: Would you have given your consent for your child to be a research subject? Why or why not?

Responses
1. If I was in that situation, I would just immediately want the paramedics to do what's best for my child. So if there was a research study going on if that's going to help him, then that's then I would be OK with that
2. If it dealt with like breakthrough medication or medication for breakthrough seizures, yes
3. If it can help him and benefit him,It'd be great
4. Again, I don't have a problem, in fact, I would be, I believe it's good. As long as there's a treatment.  It would be tougher if there was some sort of placebo involved.  In my experience,  people's biggest concern, am I actually doing something that could help me or are you going to give me something just for your research.  I guess that would be a piece of information that would be beneficial that you could reassure the parent or the caretaker that what we're doing is geared to help.  And you're collecting information along that path
5. Yeah, I think so
6. Yes, because I think through research, that's the only way we can advance in the medical field to prevent stuff

### Question: Would you want somebody else to decide if your child could be a research subject?  If so, who?

Responses
1. either any of my parents or my wife
2. Yes, if I mean if my child was having a seizure. I would utilize the research trial. Yes, I would be [OK].  You know preferably my parents or my in-laws. But I guess depending where and what the situation was.  They would just do what would be in the best interest of the child. You know, if we had a pediatrician or an ER doc that was saying, hey, I've read about this trial. I know some participants of medical insight into consideration and make that decision
3. I'd rather a health care provider make that call
4. Yes, if I am unable to give the consent, or there's something that's not allowing me to then yes, I would like, for my mom or somebody that is close to what's going on to get the consent, so yes
5. Yep. Okay
6. No, I wouldn't want anybody else to make that decision either

### Question: What do you think could be some of the challenges when doing research on emergency, time-sensitive conditions?

Responses
1. Educating the patient. Figuring out how.  In their terms so that they understand. Like 60 seconds or less explaining to him how what we're going to do is going to help him.  Most parents I've talked to whenever I've run on a seat on their child having a seizure have just said, oh good, you're here. Help my child, and if they're still actively seized. You know we use medazzaland or low Raza Pam most of the time. As our anti seizure Med, they'll just let us follow our protocol and do that. So a lot of times they don't, even for the standard treatments they don't even get educated on that, they just pretty much give us a blanket of - do what you have to do.  So, the biggest thing, would be educate
2. One of the biggest challenges is stated in the question, and potentially you have a child life at stake. So to gain true informed consent like you were saying to sit down with the parents or  the medical power of attorney and explain this in detail. That window may have passed where the interventions could make an impact. That would be the biggest challenge is like I said things are time sensitive. You know too for  life sustaining measures
3. I think the one of the biggest challenges with seizures, you have kids that are medication naive. And then you've got kids that have had a bunch of medicines. It may be hard to figure out that starting dose, even if you're basing it on the age.  Some other challenges, I mean the informed consent. The biggest thing obviously, but  when you're in an emergency situation everyone understands you do what you can to get the person back to a safer level of health
4. I guess everything you already talked about. So the time is of essence. Treatment needs to happen quickly In Pediatrics, it's weight based, so they have to do calculations, so minimizing that by looking at a chart makes the time to treatment much quicker
5. I would say like to get there faster. I understand like there's other emergencies out there. But when you're calling 911 and it seems like they take forever, and sometimes they actually do take forever to get to your to your house.  I would think that they would get there a lot faster, especially when they hear of a child having seizures, having difficulty breathing and looks like they're going to stop breathing. As a parent, I don't know, what do, you know, all I know is to put them on their side. So just in case like any fluids would come out of mouth, it wouldn't go back down. You know, how I was always told but I wouldn't know what to do
6. I guess in my own words, there's no right or wrong in research. Until it's completely done and everybody knows the exact facts. But until that point you have to do research so there's really no right or wrong answer if you're doing it right or not
7. Certainly, the overall apprehension of parents, bystanders, guardians, people who can make informed decisions, a lot of the time sensitive conditions you're speaking of are intensive from the EMS side. And there is oftentimes people that can give the best information and answer the questions are best served treating the patient. And because there's only a limited number, 1 doctor for every patient. I think that's one of the major challenges. And like I said, it's time sensitive. There's not a lot of time to do a lot of things. And, not enough bodies to get it done oftentimes
8. A lot of parents, first time children that just either haven't had a lot of medical problems, I think it is easy for parents and the bystanders to kind of freak out. If they're not comfortable with seeing somebody in not a normal state so I think another possibility that would be challenging is if you're trying to get informed consent, like over the phone for the person that's calling 911 saying hey, you know when the paramedics show up we have this XYZ possible research study.  I mean, I think just the mental state of the person is really going to be the deciding factor on if they want to hear it or not
9. I think it's just the emotions of the time is what causes a lot of delays. And then being informed to make a good decision in the emergency situation as well
10. I think that you would get turned down every time. Plus it you would get turned down by me as a caregiver every time because I don't have time to talk about it right now and understand the ins and outs and the risks and and and benefits. Just don't have time for it and my mind would be somewhere else, so I likely would say no. Just go with the tried and true treatment

### Question: What is your knowledge about the U.S. government’s regulations about doing emergency research without asking for consent ahead of time?

Responses
1. I don't have any prior knowledge
2. I do not have a lot of knowledge on that topic
3. A little bit. I mean. very basic, common sense knowledge probably is what I would boil my knowledge down to. Not like, researchers level
4. So you have to be approved by the FDA to do exception from informed consent and you have to follow strict protocols in order to get that. And one of that is community engagement, which is what you're doing today
5. I think honestly, if it saves someone's life, go for it.  I think it's good that they are looking forward to not having consent because I think a lot of times parents are iffy about doing certain things because they don't believe in like medicine. You know, some parents don't. They think they like to do like the old natural type stuff or they don't believe in medicine. I think it needs to be what the child needs
6. I don't have any knowledge about that
7. Not much
8. From my understanding if it's life threatening situations that they don't have a DNR already there with them so things like unconscious overdoses and someone in cardiac arrest or whatever you are basically given implied consent.  That yes, if they were awake, you would want to treat them for life threatening situations. I think

### Question: What concerns do you have about starting research-related treatments in an emergency situation if you could not provide consent for yourself or on behalf of your child?

Responses
1. I really wouldn't have any concerns, because if I'm going as a provider, I'm going to take part in our research.  I'm going to research out on my own or I'm going to make sure that I'm aware. Of the agents being used, the procedures, the treatments. I'm going to educate myself so that I know what I'm doing. So if say I do provide the treatment and there's a mishap, then I know what the counter treatment is or how to do corrective actions.  Or if there's a problem or a side effect, whether it be desired, whether it be a surprise side effect or or something expected. It's like anytime we do something new and add it to our protocol, I research that to make sure I know what I'm doing before I have to use it. INTERVIEWER CLARIFIES:    So you're saying that you would feel comfortable putting that trust in someone else because you expect that they would be doing similar things   Yes, I'd put trust in an EMS provider doing or a medical provider doing their research.'cause I'd trust that before doing that they would trained and educated themselves on how to properly do it
2. At this point I don't. I don't have any concerns that would come to mind. It sounds like it was outlined to provide the best possible care too
3. I think just making sure they're the best interest of the patient and the person that is in the emergency situation. I would assume that they think everybody is a full code until they find out otherwise, cause they don't have anything to go off of so I assume they're just doing everything they can to keep the person alive but not a lot of concerns necessarily, as long as they're making sure it's a safe dose and not going too crazy with the amount of medications
4. Not for this one.  I think studies that provide a placebo are more challenging, so if you have an emergency situation and you have a drug versus a placebo. That to me, is harder, because you're saying one thing might work, or they might get no treatment at all.  So that I think is harder for an effect situation, but this is a study where you're not saying they're not getting treated, you're just shortening the treatment. The time to treatment by standardizing the drug amount, that's an easier sell to me
5. I would just want them to automatically just do it. Honestly, I think that's what I would lean toward, you know, anything to help. I think if that's gonna help my child or save their life or save anybody's life, they should just go automatically do it. I actually don't have any concern, when I asked them about the medicine itself and they said, it's usually the same form of medicine that the EMS usually gives to a seizure patient. It's just now it's going by like the age of a person
6. The only concern I have would be that it's scary trying something new. You don't know how it's gonna react at first.  That would be my only concern
7. I don't have a great deal of concern. I understand why it's necessary, I've had enough occasions where, especially in our EMS system, we have evolved further into a protocol based system, we train our medics to a high level. And we allow the medics to make decisions based on protocol. And when we do finally hit a limit or a wall, we have an avenue to get further information. I do not have to call and ask a doctor for permission to make every step which as long as those FDIC regulation, protocols are structured, like a protocol, it would support the way we do business in EMS
8. If I can't provide consent for myself or my child, as long as there is a  professional on scene or there like a paramedic. If that's the case, I would say they should. They should do what they can to improve the person you know myself or my child's condition
9. My concern is that I think there should be a nationwide. Cconsent to on certain UM. Like 1 seizures for instance, I think there should be something that all medical fields should have, and if they have research technology, like on the ambulance that you know it could pull up that hey, this patient is in this research and that way it can start, you know, quicker

### Question: What do you think researchers could do to promote respect for a patient’s decision making without getting informed consent?

Responses
1. Just make sure anyone and everyone participating in it, that's going to be doing the work.  Giving the admin and administering the procedures. Make sure they're familiar with that. They're familiar with the patient rights. Make sure they should be familiar, and that if a patient says no, I don't want to do that, make sure.  Most people were going to ignore it or they won't have any clue until it happens to him
2. I would think it'd be beneficial to team up with local pediatricians. So where I'm from in Knox County. We have one hospital, Knox Community Hospital and if you could speak with their pediatricians. They could have a pamphlet or pass along information about this. Pediatrics, Wellness exams and the checkups.  When a doctor brought it up, you know this is what we're going to do. This is how it works.  They would already have that in their mind, and they wouldn't necessarily be thinking about that at that point in time. You know they'd be able to understand when that ER doctor was talking to them. You know this was covered by our pediatrician and most the time pediatricians are pretty trusted and respected by the parents, so I think that would give them a little bit of comfort if they could kind of hear it in a non emergent setting the first time
3. That's a really interesting question, actually. I think they should just treat themselves like the same. Treat them how they want to be treated by themselves, you know, make sure they're doing what's in the patients best interest. Make sure that they're keeping this patient safe, even if they have to provide emergency treatment. Honestly, I can't and I don't know very many human beings who would do something awful to somebody in an emergency.  I would assume most people would follow a code of ethics that would govern their decisions
4. I think just explaining the time constraint is probably the best way to go about it. Like you know explaining we couldn't ask you because we have 5 minutes to do treatment and if we don't do treatment within 5 minutes then you know brain function goes down or whatever it is, like that. That's probably the best way
5. Just talking to them about the research, like explaining, like the medicine in a way that they will understand, especially if it's child.  You have to make it very understandable to them, or to the parents, as well.  There a lot of parents aren't gonna understand, like, the scientific thought behind our research development so maybe like having brochures or something on it, and it really just  explaining it in terms of a parent's point of view.  Saying that it's not going to be harmful, it's not going to hurt the patient, it's here to help them
6. That I really don't know
7. Again, falling back on what I've seen over the last two years, it's a lot of education. You can't force education down people's throats, and it's very difficult to counter misinformation. But education goes a long way.  EMS is all reactive. You don't very many examples of EMS systems that are public health, public health based. Looking at prevention. We are the bandaid. But if you educate the public, the public has a better understanding about what's going on and is more likely to support the end game
8. I think I would always just come back to am I acting in this person's best interest, would I do the same for my family member?  You know, would I be OK with it being my kid or my family member, if I'm you, the researcher or whatever.  Yeah, I mean ultimately I feel like as long as you're acting in the best Interest of the person and you have the knowledge to do it
9. I think. more education out there on it.  Because there's lack of education on research, especially in school. You never hear it taught in elementary or middle school or high school.  You know, and that's the key factor how we come through, you know, mankind has got to where we are is through research. I think there should be more education.  Education of you know trial and error of research
10. Probably circling back with the parent after the emergency has maybe past and making sure that the parent is aware of the research.  Obviously, but maybe understanding like what the goal is and kind of just give a little bit of background.  So I am a parent of my kid but I like to believe I care about the larger population.  Understanding like that research is needed to get things better, it may be kids down the road, you know.  I think that would be beneficial.  There was some research done and I never really knew my kid even participated or something like that

### Question: What do you think are the benefits of doing research in emergency situations without a patient’s informed consent?

Responses
1. Now you're getting a wide variety of patients. So you'll be able to see what works, what doesn't.Uhm, and then maybe go into the why? Why did this? You have two people that are almost identical, but it worked on one but didn't work on the other.  I would probably venture to say it'll probably go along with what I mentioned earlier about the implied consent where the patient's doing bad so they would say do what you have to do to save the patient. Because they can't make a informed decision
2. The benefit is that you can gather that real time data and from a live patient and see how the trial is going. Or you know gather any  positive and negative effects from that
3. This is a loaded question too. Sometimes people don't understand what the treatment is going to do and sometimes they might overthink the informed consent process and that might hamper them from getting things that can potentially save their lives. With that being said, the benefit would be giving them stuff that they might not otherwise be able to get
4. I think it all still really just comes down to the time sensitive nature for me. Being able to have these buckets where we don't have to calculate, that's that's a cool thing
5. Well, if it's an emergency, I think that should just be performed. If it's a dire emergency, yes do it. Now if you do have the time to get the consent, then do that as well
6. The benefits would be learning more about what helps or not. You know, particularly with my son
7. Should be better for the patient.   Because there are plenty of cases where treatment couldn't be administed until entrance to the hospital and could potentially save their life, save their brain of future deficit. It's really a win for the patient
8. I think you're going to get real life feedback. And I think you're going to get a lot bigger numbers too.  A percentage of people are not interested or and may be interested, but because of the emergency don't wanna think about that or don't want to take the few seconds to process it.  Think you're gonna get better research out of it?
9. I think we learn more, that's the key factor. There is learning and especially through emergency situation, you know.  There's a reason why it's called an emergency, and I think we learn more during that
10. I do think that how are you going to move anything forward if you don't try something new.  You know, you're never going to get enough people to say yes. Let's try it because I just don't want to waste the time for you to explain it to me. And in order for me to give you a good consent, right? I'm gonna say necessary, evil. It's something that needs to be done in order  to, get better treatments for kids like this or adults.  So you gotta take a risk, I mean to see the benefits you're eventually going to have to take a risk

### Question: Do you have any questions after watching the video? 

Responses
1. No
2. My biggest question and the only thing that really stood out to me when I read through your information that was sent in the survey beforehand.   How do they determine which age buckets to create?  I just wondered about like the weight percentile and what happens if a child falls well below or above the percentile of weight for a particular age group
3. No, all my questions were answered when I did watch the video for the first time
4. Not really, I know my son has been on that Midazolam before. And then when he was on it,  I think it was .5 mils per nostril is what they dosed it at.  It wasn't based on weight, it was, they claimed it was based off his age
5. It makes good sense, I think that's why I chose to particiate
6. Nope
7. No, I don't
8. I know that there's ranges of the doses that based on age my son specifically is a good, I think a good case study. He's very small for his age like the bottom of the chart. Or something like that to just give a little bit of extra more than it's a 12 year old because my 12 year old is probably half the size of another 12 year old

### Question: What questions do you have about the study? 

Responses
1. Not right now
2. I think that EG is interesting. So how are you deciding who gets the EG and who doesn't? Or is that randomized?
3. Well, when he said that, if given too much, it could slow or stop the person from breathing, with this research will you guys really gonna figure out like, the actual age and make sure it's the right dose? And it's not gonna make them stop breathing?  You're gonna be sure that the doses are properly measured, you know, that it's horrible to think about, giving too much, it can make you stop breathing. It's scary to think about
4. No yet
5. I think the only one that I've thought of so far is the study is basically looking at using either IM or through the nose. Is there a specific device that the study is going to be giving to do that because the devices that we use are basically called a mad device. But it feels like, it's almost made for an adult's nose?  I suppose small amounts may not matter, but like there's a lot of times where if you push it really slow, it almost is going to drip out. It's not going to atomize the way that the device designed.  Is the study going to have a specific the device you want to use for kid sized noses and kind of eliminate the risk for just dripping it into their nose instead of spraying essentially
6. No, I don't
7. I don't think I have any

### Question: What had you heard about this study before today?

Responses
1. I've first got the information through the pediatric emergency care coordinators network
2. When I was at the clinic with Nate for his follow up my son. They just told me about it.  Other than that I hadn't heard of it before now
3. Just what I was sent in the email the other day, but nothing prior to that
4. When I took my son in last week, I actually had not heard nothing about the study, until they had come in and talked to me about it.  So I didn't even know this was actually going on. So when he was telling me, I was intrigued about it, because my daughter also loves like science, loves learning about different research developments. So I explained to her when she got home from school that day about the research, so she actually liked it. But before then nothing. And like what you're telling me now I know a lot more than what I did
5. Just the little bit we talked about. At the hospital
6. Other than what I read on the material you sent, and then the video, nothing else
7. Our department basically just put out the video you showed me and said hey, this is something that we're going to be a part of. The study we're going to be a part of so if you're interested in participating, send an email in UM. That's pretty much it.  That's all I've heard
8. Nothing, just the survey
9. When we were we were in the emergency room for seizures and I think that one of folks working with you presented the idea to us and did a good job. I did get to see the video. And we had a bit of a conversation to explain. Like I said before my question about size versus age. Things like that, so I felt like I knew what you were trying to get at. Probably prior to us getting on today

### Question: What have you heard about the study so far that did not make sense?

Responses
1. Everything is pretty straightforward, I don't have any lingering questions
2. I think everything pretty much makes sense. They're trying to figure out how to optimize dosing, as in emergency situations for kids
3. Nothing
4. Well, it was the dosage part. But you answered my question. So that was basically the only thing that didn't make sense when you brought up about how they could stop breathing, if given too much.  What happens when somebody actually is rejecting that medicine, like it's not working for them after the two doses, like hey're still not at the hospital? Yeah, that's what I was trying to figure out
5. I understand what you're planning on doing
6. Not sure anything hasn’t made sense.   So far, the parameters to your study aren't very far from our protocols. So the medications are our standard medications. Your delivery dosing is similar to ours, although we still use a lot of IV delivery system. But I understand that we're looking to be  more universal system so that your study has to be more universal. I have no problems with doing intranasal we have great success with it
7. I don't think anything I'm good so far
8. Nothing really
9. Makes perfect sense

### Question: Based on what you just heard, do you have any questions about WHAT we plan to do in this study?

Responses
1. The study I know is to see what works to get patients to quit seizing before they get to the hospital. If I understand correctly. Is that going to be or the EMS providers going to have questionnaires to fill out? Or is that going to be based off of what they document? In their EMS reports
2. No, you know the  video did a pretty good job explaining it and then your slides after the video explaining. Once you inform the parents they can choose to withdraw the participant from the study. So Nope, I don't have any questions on how
3. Nope, that makes sense
4. No
5. How will you test the study out like, are you going to be doing it on actual live people or are you doing like a simulator type thing?
6. It sounds like now instead of using a broad slow tape or making some assumptions based on patient size to to generate weight, it's just going to be figuring out their age. Hopefully a bystander knows the rage. So if you come upon a patient, there is no bystander, which sadly happens. Will there still be a fallback for size and weight?  Or are you now putting it on the medics to make some guesses on age?
7. Just for clarification, there was mention of an EEG device, like a headband placed on the kids, but that's once they get to the hospital, right?  I'm not familiar with what that device is, but I kind of thought man, that's probably not cheap, but if it's feasible for us to have on the kid before we get in there to be beneficial. You know, that's something to look at as well, but I just want to make sure that wasn't something that we were expected to have
8. No

### Question: A minor CHILD/family member is having a seizure when the paramedics arrived to your home. He/she meets the qualifications to participate in the pedidose study. Would you agree to have him or her being included in the research study without your permission or your family's permission ahead of time?

Responses
1. I'd agree to and I agree to being included
2. Yes, I would agree
3. I would as long as they had the first set up on the ambulance. Are you guys going to have everything you need to like, be able to reverse it if the child stops breathing or have the stuff available in case something happens that's too much.  INTERVIEWER CLARIFIES:  Respondent:  So yes, I. Would agree there
4. Yes
5. Yes I would
6. Yes
7. I would, I guess I have the understanding, I mean, an adult seizure is full, the majority of pediatric seizures I've taken in my career have been febrile type. By the time you hit an adult person, a new adult seizure is a big deal. So yeah, I would
8. Yes, I would

1. I'd agree to and I agree to being included
2. Yes I would
3. Yes
4. Yes
5. Yes
6. I would. Because it would likely be an unknown, so I'd rather have been treated. Yes
7. Yes, I would

2. I would let him, oh yeah
3. They could participate
4. I would have my child participate. I would give consent
5. I'd still be OK with it
6. I would let him. Yeah I would have him participate in it
7. I would have them participate

### Question: How important do you think it is to do this study in your community?

Responses
1. Extremely important
2. I think that it's a good choice with this community.  Anything to streamline the Verset administration and you know, kind of take the guesswork out of correct dosing, it's always going to be a  winner in my book
3. I think it's very important because I don't know the studies or what's behind seizures.  If it will continue, but I think obviously there's lots of risk to having prolonged seizures and stop breathing just from that alone and brain damage, so it's important
4. It's probably pretty important. I mean, there are a fair amount of kids that have seizures every year and a lot of times we don't even know why. So I mean, being able to treat them so we can stabilize them and figure out what's going on is a good thing
5. I think it's really important, honestly. You know, there is a lot of people that probably have seizures around here. I I wouldn't know personally, but I know some friends and stuff that have kids that have experienced seizures or has epilepsy, so I think this research is really nice to have in our community.  I follow this thing on my phone it shows where the ambulances or anything is like distributed. So like certain addresses, it gives off what they're going for and a lot of them have seizure.  So I think it's a very good thing for our community. I think it would help a lot
6. It is really important. Because like I said, it is a learning curve and the more we learn, the better you know EMS could help. In any event you know they would have to be taken in
7. It's huge. It's very important. We're a large and growing population. And we've got an enormous number of kids in the community. And sadly, I think we're almost seeing a decrease in preventive care. And, again, it's likely based on where I work, and the community that I serve but I see a lot of children who have less than what I would consider ample preventative care, and a lot of under informed or completely uninformed parents. So yes, it's important
8. I think it's super important. I mean we have huge population which I'm sure is why you guys are choosing the places you've chosen.  A large population and a lot of kids, so anything we can do to not only reduce the stress on the paramedics but just get the child treated quicker you know, I think it's a great thing, so there's only one way to find out if that will work or not. I guess is to do the study so I'm all for it
9. I think it's very important
10. I think this is very important, so just because I understand a little bit more probably than a typical mom would about seizures. That five minute thing terrified me every second that goes past five minutes is a second of what is going to happen. So yeah, I think it's very important

### Question: What is your understanding about this study’s purpose?

Responses
1. It's find a better way to treat seizures and stop the seizure.  Patient gets this a quicker way to stop the seizures safely in a patient
2. it's going to streamline the dosing. Currently, for pediatric dose with the administration of midazolam. I'm all in favor of it
3. To prevent the detrimental effects of prolonged seizures
4. So my understanding is that you're trying to figure out which dosing of medication works best for kids from six months to 13 years old. Based on age buckets within the age buckets, they're small, medium, large, and  extra large sizing guides and so the paramedics when they show up on the scene will give the dose of based on, I'm assuming they have like a card or something with this info, like a chart. So what they just need is knowledge of the child's age and their relative size, and then consent will be given afterwards and descent for older kids
5. Something like this, that's going to be involving by age and not by weight, I think it's really nice because I'm used to always being asked by weight for medicine, you know
6. This study's purpose is to be able to get the seizure to basically stop. Before you even got to the hospital to help. What's the best way to put this? It wouldn't say to better quality of life. It would be more to prevent death, I should say
7. My understanding about the study is  going to be looking at treatment of seizures by EMS prehospital reducing the the number of kids still rolling in the door seizing.  To reduce the potential Neurosystem trauma and then I think there's also probably a some secondary purpose within the study to research treatment without informed consent. But I think that's that will end up being secondary to the real purpose
8. So I kind of think it's about implied consent.  We feel about informed consent as a community versus having somebody enrolled without the families knowledge right up front and and then also I think to see if the age related dosing versus weight based dosing is more accurate or more successful, or at least as successfu as the weight base that we currently do
9. How they save lives
10. I believe that the purpose is to stop or to reduce the number of kids that are actively or people that are actively seizing when they get to the hospital. Uh, and to probably streamline the the protocols for like the EMS workers

### Question: What is your understanding about why the ambulance agencies will be randomly assigned to when they will switch methods of dose determination?

Responses
1. I don't have much background in research, I really don't know
2. Basically, they'll be utilizing their current protocols. And then they're going to switch to the pedidose. So I guess my understanding would be randomized so that you weren't getting cluster data points in one specific area of that city?
3. So there's no bias, also just to like make It a valid study 'cause I know in studies you have to have a wide range, they might find one way is better
4. To reduce bias
5. I think that it's because when different people get assigned to it and everything before anybody else. They'll get to see if there's any change. From this research you know, so I think it's good to do it at different time, giving them to different different EMS at different times because I think it would help you know the people, the EMS people that haven't gotten it yet could see what the outcome is
6. Well, there's there's a wrong and there's right. But you don't know which way is the best way to determine dose until you've tried all the different ways and you find the best way
7. It's research, it's randomizing. It's the only way you can determine is it the delivery service that's making a difference or the treatment that's making a difference? So if that makes sense
8. I understand there's got to be the best results. Kind of like blind, blind randomization kind of deal so that there's no placebo effects I guess.  I can't really see why they would do that, but I assume that's what it is
9. RESPONDENT IS CONFUSED
10. I think it's so that you were getting a good cross sampling of data so the maybe the old method versus the new method or outside the study inside the study

- Theme 4: Ensuring a Diverse Data Sample [10]

### Question: What concerns, if any, do you have about the random assignment of the ambulance agencies regarding when they switch to the new method of dosing?

Responses
1. They will be trained. Only concern I'd have is making sure that when the dosing switches and the new thing comes out, making sure that the providers truly do what they're supposed to do.  There's always been a push to change and do things better but wait, we're changing what we've always done, it's always worked. But the push to get providers to try something that might work better? And getting some providers to switch to that is difficult at times
2. I do not have any
3. Human beings in general [Interviewer words: A little hesitant for change], but  I don't think I'll have that much resistance 'cause most EMS people are pretty much like OK, we're doing it, but just saying, you know, I don't think that could be a concern or a challenge, but I don't think it should stop you from doing the study
4. Just make sure your communication is very clear so that they're giving the right treatment. At the right time. Turnover can be high too, might not have the same people
5. Probably wondering if it's really going to work or if there's really any difference to it. That's probably my concern. Since they've always been using the the standard way of doing by asking the weight and stuff.  Or probably being a little unsure about doing without permissions. You know if they were to do it. Or to give it without anybody's consent, you know 'cause we've always done by consent. I think they might be on edge with it,  you never know
6. I don't have a concern.  Because no matter what, it's still going to be scary. I mean for the parents, it's just watching your child seize on the floors, you know. It it is scary. But the best part of it all is when they come out of it and if you ican do that quicker would be better. You know, if they can find a better way of doing it
7. No
8. Honestly, I'm not sure I understand why.  I don't know to me if you want you want to get as much data as possible on the new process or the new dosing.  The new the consent factor of it. So why some agencies wouldn't switch? I assume the study has its reasons why, but I don't understand it.  To me, I think you'd want as many numbers as you can. I assume you already have the research and the data for the old system or the the old method, which is why we're trying something new
9. No, I don't. I think that's a really good setup. I really do
10. I don't really know that I have any concerns. I would just want mine to be like first so that they were in this study

Themes
- Theme 1: Concerns about implementation and adherence to the new method [1, 4, 5]
- Theme 2: No concerns or doubts about the new method [2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10]

### Question: What are your fears or worries, if any, regarding the study? 

Responses
1. None as long as if it comes out with valid point.  Biggest thing is if it comes out with valid points that are going to help us help people, just getting the answers out and then getting the EMS world to change
2. No, Sir
3. I think just safety, but I'm pretty sure that safety for you guys is forefront too and then so I don't really have any big concerns to be honest with you
4. Nothing comes to mind
5. You answered them with the dosage part so I'm good
6. At this point, I don't think I have any
7. I don't think so. I guess maybe more for the last question. I feel like by not switching or getting the opportunity out as quickly as possible we're still running the risk that kids aren't getting the potential appropriate dosing as quickly as they could. So I  guess if I was one of those kids parents I said, you guys are doing a study and my kid could have received the accurate, the proper dosing sooner, and you didn't do that. I don't know
8. That we won't get that there won't be enough people participating in it
9. Getting too much of that medicine. It is a strong medicine. But the flip side of that is that you are with an ambulance and they are monitoring your breathing. EMS workers and they have oxygen and things like that are there so I don't know that there's a lot of risk if you have the rescue medicine at home. it'd be more scary for me to say, hey, we're going to have you do this, and it's going to be based on an age range. That is more concerning because I'm not a medical professional.  EMS folks and the tools are there that if the breathing did slow down that they could address that. I don't think that I have a lot of worries about it

### Question: How do you feel about not having a choice about participation in the study?

Responses
1. If it's an emergency situation. I don't have any problem with that, I don't see any difference then giving someone the medications, under the protocol.  I'd be comfortable either way
2. I mean they don't have a choice initially. If the criteria is met, but it's all for the benefit of that patient. You're not testing a new drug. My understanding is we're testing a new dose calculation if you will.  It's  the same route of administration, same medication. And then you do give them a choice to continue with the participation. So I think it's a pretty well rounded plan
3. I think it's fine. This is an emergency situation. This is something where you are trying to help a kid, not hurt him. The alternative is you let them go to the emergency room, seizing longer and potentially having more complications  I don't have any concerns about the fact that you don't have a choice, it's an emergency thing. Like I said, if you have a diabetic and their sugars 35, you're going to give him glucose so you can save their life. So kind of a similar principle
4. I think that's OK for this study, which I think we already talked about. Other studies would not be as good for me
5. I don't think it would bother me
6. Like I said, it's scary trying something new. Sometimes it's quicker to just do it then to ask if they can do it. Because what if somebody, parent or guardian is in shock and they can't answer that question. EMS needs to act right away, not wait five minutes, to get an answer
7. It would bother me, but I understand that's just how that's how research works
8. It's fine, I don't mind at all. I think it's necessary, I think it's a good thing and I'm glad it's something science is looking at. Especially for the size department that we have it's good
9. I'm all for, not having the choice in it because you know it is for to save lives
10. It does not matter to me at all

### Question: Why do you feel that way, and are those reasons related to prior experiences you or others have had?

Responses
1. My son had been in trouble.  My son has been in prolonged seizures and every time he was no longer in a seizure, I kept thinking what is this going to do longterm.  So the one ambulance they didn't even give him medicine, they just put a pulse ox on him and let him seize. So I feel like if we had a standardization, kids could have a lot better chance of not having bad things come because of the seizures
2. Oh about like the placebo versus treatment. Well, I just think that something is wrong. We should treat It if we can. And so I think it would be hard to give us placebo to a kid with exception from informed consent. I think if you had a chance to talk about it with the families, that's a different thing. But with exception from informed consent that would be hard
3. My worst experience was when my son was black and blue on the floor and they had to ask for our consent. I wish I would have just done it right away Instead of asking for consent
4. I don't think so, I don't want my kids necessarily being just Guinea pigs for for anything random, but I think any parent that you know if they're see their child having a seizure whether it's their first time or not, ultimately it's going to say, please do something to fix it, get them better. Study a way of doing that. Even if they don't know that they're being part of a study right off the bat. As long as it looks like you're acting professionally and doing the job to get them better, that's all that they worry about, I suppose so
5. Yeah, 'cause I think you know with like seizures it's life threatening.  And I know people that have passed away from seizures and there's not enough information, so that's why I am all for it. Not getting consent for the study

- Theme 1: Concerns about immediate treatment and standardization [1, 2, 3]
- Theme 2: Willingness for children to be part of studies for better outcomes [4, 5]

### Question: What, if anything, is there that could change regarding the details of this study to make you feel comfortable with being enrolled without your permission?

Responses
1. I honestly can't think of anything
2. No kind of like I mentioned a bullet point back that I would feel very comfortable with my child or family member being enrolled.  Everything is  pretty straightforward, so I I don't think we need to make anything more comfortable
3. I think that the best thing is if people are armed with the knowledge of why you're doing it.  Like I mentioned, it's an emergency measure.  This is what they'll do in the emergency room anyways, and more than likely they're going to get the same, like it's for safety.  We want to get the kid out of the seizure safely and get better chance of having better outcomes
4. Nothing
5. Just by having somebody explaining it. Yeah, I think that would would bring comfort.  Talking about how when you're asking about the permission, just like explaining it to them in a way that they would understand, very calm, just being very kind and not like very rough. You know how sometimes your EMS can be like brutish sometimes. Just like being very calm and cool and collected just explaining hey, we're gonna do this and everything that we're doing. Just explain, like not scaring the patient
6. No really
7. The only thing that has come into my mind either during this interview or reading through stuff or thinking about is dosing based solely on age and we don't have. Somehow we end up in a case where we don't know a person's age. Well, he looks like my 3 year old. As long as there is a a solid backup and there's a number of good solid backups so that a patient doesn't go untreated
8. Nothing is coming to mind honestly
9. There's really ain't anything
10. I don't need anything else

### Question: How do you think this study might improve medical care for children with seizures?

Responses
1. From what I know now, if it could find ways to more quickly and efficiently stop the seizure, I think it might help  recovery.  Help children and then if it works in children, maybe we can roll it into adults.  Now help all people with seizures. Help them recover quicker from their seizure
2. You know getting the medication in at  the correct dose in a timely fashion. That in and of itself is  going to improve the outcomes for these pediatric seizure patients. So as far as improving the medical care, it's just going to. It's going to be less work on the child's body. They don't have to stay in that convulsion phase
3. Yeah, I think it just really decreases the risk of complications from prolonged seizures. Again, that brain damage that enacts.  The other fact that kids will be able to. You know, I feel like kids can regress after seizures and so the biggest thing is getting him out of it as soon as safely and as soon as possible and giving him a better chance of. Uhm, yeah, just having a good outcome
4. Just faster stopping time of the seizure
5. Well, if the research does work and it does show a good amount of decrease and the seizures stopped before reaching the hospital, I think it would be good. You know, if it does show that it works, I think it would be awesome
6. I think it could get them help quicker. To save a life
7. Hopefully it improves it and reducing the number of kids who are still actively seizing when we roll in the door. Columbus we're lucky, our most remote crews are still even with traffic within 35 minutes. That's a long time, but still within 35 minutes as this expands and moves into agencies that are in the 45 minute, 60 minute plus window from a pediatric hospital or from a hospital in general it will greatly improve
8. If this study ends up being successful improving the medication and dosing and route work more effectively and not only causes less stress for medics, but you know, for the family members and gets the patient the proper treatment as quickly as possible, and that's obviously ultimately the goal. I think it's great, I'm actually kind of excited about it because it's anything with Pediatrics is very nerve wracking. You know, it's usually because of the parents on scene and how they act and react. You're kind of performing for them
9. I think it will save lives in children

### Question: Who do you think would possibly benefit from this study?

Responses
1. The  biggest benefit in your prehospital care with your IMO. To where that dose is streamlined and you know currently there are some  Apps like hand TV or different things that you can use on your phone, but it would come in a standard dose kit, it's just one less thing. To open an app it's just one less step. Really going to streamline the entire process
2. Any kid that has a seizure
3. Any kid that has a seizure
4. Probably the parents. You know 'cause they wouldn't see their child seizing it's not agood thing. I know with mine it wasn't seeing them the shaking, the foaming from the mouth, eyes rolling in the back of the head. It's not. It's not pretty to see, so I think doing this research and seeing that their child is going to be OK and come out of the seizure slowly and knowing that they're going to be OK, I think is a good thing. I think it would help put parents at ease. I know it would mean
5. The person that would benefit the most would be the child or person  that's having the seizure.  The EMS would definitely benefit from learning more
6. It should be the kids and should be the parents. In fact, it really should be everybody because resolving deficits from seizures can lead to deficits over time depending on a person's status they can rely on some sort of aid it can Increase the cost to society.  It can make it so the person has less options for employment which could limit their life.  I mean everybody really should benefit.  Definitely the patient and the family. And then in the broader scope, everyone
7. I would say obviously the child themselves, the patient. You know short term and long term, but I think also EMS is going to benefit from again not having to think about the calculations as much and having to just be able to act. Hopefully would then make it easier for hospital staff that they can pursue other things other then the seisure. If we can get it taken care of before we get there
8. Patients with seizures
9. I really think anybody that possibly could have a seizure would benefit from this. I think that if you're a mom and you've never and you've never seen a seizure so honestly it may benefit kids who don't have a history more typically than than a kid like mine. Where I can rattle off all of the information that they probably need. So I truly think it could benefit. Honestly, the entire population of anybody who might have a seizure

### Question: Is there any reason, other than the qualifying criteria we have gone over, that you think someone should not be able to be enrolled without their permission?

Responses
1. I know some peers I have, some medics at certain areas that have trouble getting the family intervenes and won't let them do stuff for religious reasons.  There's certain religious groups I know that would say, no, especially someone would say, well, no, let it ride it out. Don't give him the medicine because it's God's will. When God's ready, they'll let him stop seizing. I've actually dealt with that and not been allowed to do treatments on patients because of that
2. No, you've covered most of the bases
3. No, I think it's pretty straightforward
4. I guess the only thing I can think of is if you have a kid with known epilepsy or seizures. Where they have a drug that we know and a dose we know works for them. It would be preferable to use what's already known to work for them as opposed to trying something else
5. I don't see why anybody can't be enrolled without their permission.  I think everybody should be able to get it without permission if it's going to help
6. No
7. Not that I can think of
8. No, I don't think so
9. No
10. No

### Question: Who do you think should be included in this community consultation process?

Responses
1. You've already hitting the emergency departments, the hospitals, EMS provider  I'd say maybe the health department. They might be able to notify parents of potential candidates
2. I mentioned earlier talking with the  pediatricians. Anytime you can involve a  family physician or a you know primary care provider. That is going to put the patient or  the parents minds at ease. EMS agencies that are going to be used and talk to the EMS, Lieutenant or you're down in Columbus, a battalion chief with a superior that's going to kind of oversee the paramedics that are involved with this study
3. Parents who have kids with seizures and the physicians who treat seizures, emergency medical people, they would probably be important to have two. Then even EMS people so they can give a little bit of background, what they've seen, how they can help you know what they do now
4. I guess like parents of young kids especially, I think especially parents of kids who haven't had seizures because parents who have kids who have had seizures are already well versed in what's going on, but parents of kids who haven't, it's uncharted territory. Their thoughts might be more helpful
5. I would say parents.  Parents or anybody that does have seizures that are adult. Maybe even kids, I can understand like older kids that have seizures. Then like older adults. Who experienced seizures should be involved?
6. I think the public should be well informed on what's going on.  I believe everybody should be informed
7. Certainly open to parents, school leaders, and community leaders.  I  would involve members of the church and religious because I've had more occasions for people concerned about treatment based upon their personal understanding of religion. I guess faith communities were involved, they could go a long way if they understand, and then they communicate out to their congregations. You would have a much higher success and acceptance rate. I think you would see a big improvement or a big benefit that would be a huge part of the community that I would involve
8. Basically doing what you're doing now before it gets approved.  I would say any child that's gone to you know children hospital or close to homes or whatever they have. Either been given medication and cine in with seizures. I mean maybe reaching out to them. Hey, what do you think about this?
9. I think local hospitals. And then I think  the Community, I think the City Council or local government should be involved to discuss it as well
10. Obviously parents of kids with seizure disorders

### Question: Who should the study team need to hear from before presenting this study to the institutional review board that approves studies like this?

Responses
1. Same we've talked about
2. I think that the EMS personnel would be the best, best ones to hear back from. Essentially, they're going to be the boots on the ground. They're going to be the ones responsible for checking those boxes
3. I think the emergency room physicians and team would be an important group because they can speak to seeing kids coming in, ith seizures, and, you know, speak to what they see.  Then the neurologists that take care of epilepsy. Those guys are important.  On EMS too, 'cause I think they enjoy protocols that allow them to fall back on knowing what to do safely
4. Like maybe people like us like how you're doing this interview. Maybe just listening to our point of view
5. I think they should hear from the doctors, like the neurology team
6. The EMS community, the hospitals, the children hospitals that are receiving these kids and then before presenting the study to the review board. Gosh, I almost want to say the parents as well
7. I think it's actual patients and parents of the patients
8. Just parents or folks that can speak with experience with seizures and without experience with seizures

Themes
- Theme 1: Medical Professionals' Input [2, 3, 5, 6]
- Theme 2: Patients and Parents' Perspectives [4, 6, 7, 8]

### Question: If your child had a seizure and was included in this study, who would you have wanted the study team to talk to before this study was approved by the board?

Responses
1. Same as above, mainly paramedics, ER, staff, and especially neurologist doctors it's best they are specific to seizures
2. I'd want them to have talked with the paramedics. Keep everybody on the same page that you know those medics know what this study is about. And that they are pushing the same medication that they've used in the past. It's just going to be in a different form. That they understand that it's designed to streamline this process and take the math out of it if you will take the  numbers out of this
3. Just who I mentioned, the doctors that take care of Kids during the emergency and then the neurologists that see the kids for epilepsy. The experts
4. I guess the paramedics. Do they feel like this is going to be helpful or hurtful to their workflow? Will they abide by it? Do they agree to the procedures? Is it going to be easy for them? Are they going to forget?
5. Me probably most likely me or my family
6. The opinions of families that deal with seizures. Because they have the most experience with seizures, they know how their child or whoever they may live with how to deal with them
7. I'm running with the assumption that I would want to make sure that the study team has gone to lengths to Emergency room or Emergency medical professionals on the hospital side because they're seeing all the prehospital patients that are transported and they're seeing the walk-in patients and they have a huge voice. If that voice isn't included, then I'm not sure the study is valid either
8. The actual paramedics on the streets and the medical directors of the different departments, fire departments or EMS departments. And kind of just making sure that they're all on the same page.  I mean 'cause I think that's one thing you guys are going to now
9. Well, I think they should talk to your  local hospitals as well
10. The doctor, I would assume like neurologists should be included in that. Possibly a pharmacist just because it's got the medication involved

### Question: How would you prefer to receive information about studies like this?

Responses
1. I'm good with, I personally get a lot from email
2. Email worked pretty well.  There's a pretty good network of Emergency care coordinators across Ohio anyways. And it is a nationwide group as well, but I think if you can reach out to those. Joe Stack with the Ohio Department of EMS. He does a good job with getting this type of information out
3. Email.  I have some medical journals that I read sometimes and even just community papers might not be a bad idea like the little local ones
4. Like if I were part of the community and didn't know anyone, I guess, pediatricians offices. That's probably the best spot
5. email
6. Email, print media. There's not many people who use newspapers anymore, but certainly television. Most still have local agencies and they have community boards, you know basic places to get some information out. Posters at children clinics and pediatricians and certainly get the word out to pediatricians because those kids are getting regular pediatric care and would have hopefully at least one annual exposure to the pediatrician who could communicate this information out
7. email, billboards around the city, essentially, is your kid at risk of having a seizure?  Call this number or whatever text this number, I don't know
8. I think through, social media would be good. And through email
9. emails, newsletters

### Question: What media or methods should be used to inform the community about the PediDOSE study? 

Responses
1. Social media is probably going to be your best bet with what I see
2. The hospital newsletters, those go out kind of as direct mail or they go to current resident. Talk with the EMS agencies and even hospitals and publish on Facebook.  A lot of parents utilize Facebook and you know, maybe pay for an ad kind of select the demographics that that you want this to reach. Have it have it pop up in their news feed.  Maybe infiltrate a mom group on Facebook and start a discussion about it
3. I would probably say not direct mailers. 'cause I hate to say this but they go right into my recycling bin.  Radio stations, I don't know who listens to that but I'm sure you can tailor some stuff.  It sounds kind of weird, but even like billboards like just a quick billboard on the highway a really frequented highway. I think that would be helpful
4. Radio would probably be good. Or podcasts if you have like pediatric podcasts that people listen.  Direct mailers get tossed without really being  looked at, so it might be a waist of time
5. the radio, the mail, the papers, anything to get the word out
6. I believe 90% of people listen to the radio while they're driving, so that would be great and out the quickest
7. Definitely the hospitals and anytime  any kid goes through, but specifically ones that have had seizures or had seizure disorders come through the hospital, they should automatically be on a list indicating they've had seizures. Whatever study could be linked to using the appropriate hospital to target those patients specifically and send them Flyers. For future. I don't know if anybody needs newspaper anymore. But maybe they do
8. I think come to local hospitals that most of them has the new flyers and I think that would be a good way. I think at doctor's offices as well, flyers and billboards or posters as well
9. community organizations, direct mailers. Or newsletters from hospitals

### Question: If community consultation were not feasible, what other methods do you think we should use to gather feedback on how best to do emergency research like this?

Responses
1. I really don't know
2. I don't know that I have a good answer for that question
3. It's really the people in the trenches, like the emergency providers, staff like in the EMS people to be honest with you because they're the ones who are actually enacting the research. And can tell you good and bad outcomes and give you an idea of what's best so. It would be the ones I would go to usually
4. Maybe going into daycares, kids groups where there are parents would be good because you'd have access to a lot of people at once and you already know that they are in your demographic
5. Maybe like through email, talking to the parents inside the hospital. You know just to get their feedback
6. The Internet, like a website
7. Adults I know are not great about annual consultation but they're great about going into the hospital or their doctor when they're sick. But while you've still got the pediatric population Pediatric patients go to their doctor for annual checkups, so get the pediatricians on board. Communicate with the pediatricians so that they communicate and if they have additional resources like newsletters, emails, whatever they send out, but posters and then word of mouth out of NP's and pediatricians that work directly with those kids and those families
8. Having the research team from your guys, I love the video that you guys had with the doc explaining everything or having someone physically come in to all these departments and over the course of a couple weeks just bringing in large groups of paramedics to see basically bringing them in
9. I think by calling people
10. I truly do think that the way I was presented with it because we were in the emergency room is a good option. You know, primary care doctors could could be a good ave. Any kind of like parents groups that are related to medical kinds of reason
